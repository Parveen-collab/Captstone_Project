Learn More Full-Stack Developer Help us design and build more awesome eCommerce platforms. We're the tiny team behind open-source projects like Sapper Commerce, commercial products like Litekart. We're hiring another programmer to help us build more awesome features and UI for the eCommerce platform. About The Job We're looking for someone to work closely with Swadesh (that's me, the guy who created Litekart!) to help shape and build the future of our tools and products. You'd spend your time developing and improving existing projects, for example: Integrate new e-commerce web designs Building new components and pages Implementing a componentization strategy for our Litekart templates to extract repeated patterns and make our existing components easier to maintain and faster to develop as well as contributing directly at the product strategy and creative level to new projects, such as: Designing and developing learning management platform, hospital management, garage management Planning and developing a new SaaS eCommerce Building a live interactive demo application using Litekart to help potential customers see what's possible Adding support for multiple themes to Litekart We'd also do a ton of open-source work together, like: Working on new Litekart features like dark mode support or animations We're Only Four People (you'd Be Number Five) Which Means That Even Though We Each Have Our Areas Of Expertise, We All Wear Many Hats. We're Looking For a Programmer, But You'd Also Help Out With Things Like Managing GitHub issues and fixing bugs Writing and improving the documentation for the tools we make Writing test cases for the frontend as well as back Answering customer support questions Troubleshooting problems for users in places like Twitter and Discord If you've ever maintained an open-source project, working with us carries a lot of the same responsibilities. Here are a few recent projects you might have worked on if you were already part of the team: About You We're looking for someone with very strong front-end skills who is an expert in Javascript, with experience in a back-end framework like NodeJS. More important than specific technical skills though is that you're a strong problem solver who loves to learn — we're not experts in everything and we don't expect you to be either. You might not call yourself a designer, but you know great UI design when you see it and you know when something isn't up to par. Details matter to you, and if the text in a button is off-center by a pixel you will go to the end of the earth to figure out why. We don't care if you went to school (I dropped out of both university and college!), we just care about what you can do and how you do it. We're all just makers and tinkerers, so as long as you love to build awesome stuff you'll fit right in. Here are some of the technologies we work with day-to-day right now: NodeJS, MongoDB, Svelte, React, Vue, TailwindCSS, Flutter Pay And Benefits This is a full-time (50-hour per week) position, and you can choose your own hours. All we ask is that you plan to overlap around ~4 hours per day with 7am-9pm IST because I am sick of always programming by myself. The salary for this position is between 4,00,000 — 9,00,000 INR based on experience. We are not interested in tracking time but just to guide you on the right track you will be tracking for the initial few days. We are committed to working at a sustainable and healthy pace, and we believe 9-10 hours is more than enough time to get a solid day's work done. How To Apply To apply, write something specifically for this position that tells us why we're a great fit for each other, and what you see the future being like if we work together. Tell us what you're excited about in the industry these days, and what you're betting on for the future. Is there a project or feature you'd love for us to build together? Tell us about that too! We don't ask for your resume but that doesn't mean we're not interested in what you've worked on in the past, we're just leaving it up to you to tell your own story the way you want to tell it. We understand that not everyone has the same amount of time to dedicate to their application (I work from home with a four-year-old!), so don't feel like you need to spend 12 hours on it to stand out. As long as you sound like someone who could be a great fit when we're actually working together day-to-day with the same time constraints, we really want to meet you. Give us a link to whatever you put together in the ""Your application"" field when applying. We're accepting applications until Aug 15, 2022 at 10pm IST. There are no bonuses or penalties for submitting early or close to the deadline, so submit your application whenever works best for your own schedule. We're planning to start interviews early Aug, and aiming for a start date of mid Aug. Can't wait to hear from you! Skills:- MongoDB and Express",,,,

Learn More Innoviti Payment Solutions (Innoviti) started its payments business in 2008 and quickly established itself as a pioneer in solving difficult problems in the payments space using technology. Innoviti’s aim is to fuel India’s growth by helping drive a cashless economy. We believe this will release a tremendous amount of money in the Indian market that will ease the availability of credit to fuel entrepreneurship, create jobs and improve the living standards of every Indian. Only technology and a talented team that can put technology to use can address this tough problem. Innoviti is a well-funded company backed by marquee investors such as Titan Company (JV between Tata Group and TIDCO) and Catamaran Ventures (founded by Mr. N. R. Narayana Murthy) and NIIC, Canada. The company has been winner of several awards including Deloitte fastest growing company in APAC award three years in a row and Red Herring award twice. We hold 4 patents with 7 more in pipeline. Our business involves developing products that use technology to remove friction in a) the supply of money (credit) and b) movement of money. These seemingly simple objectives are actually very tough problems. Today less than 7% of entrepreneurs get access to capital to grow. Less than 8% of purchases happen through electronic money. Solving these tough problems in sustainable ways that are scalable and profitable is a tough challenge! To address these problems we have built some remarkable products such as uniPAY and smelending.com that today process more than Rs 10,000 Cr. of transactions annually. Leading customers such as Reliance Retail, Lifestyle, Yatra, Indigo, Inox, Tanishq, BPCL, WalMart are using these products. What makes us feel really proud is how cleverly we have used technology to make short-term credit available to more than 24,000 small businesses. Without technology, the challenges in supplying credit to this segment was not profitable for lenders and these businesses were unable to grow. If our track record is anything to go by, we have already made a small dent in the world of payments! We are now looking for enhancing our team with talented individuals who are ready to address more complex challenges and make a bigger dent! Would you like to join this journey?
